# üåê Project 5 ‚Äì Social Network (Spring 2025)

This project simulates a **social network** using Java and custom data structures. It focuses on building and analyzing a directed graph to explore key concepts in graph theory, social connections, and algorithmic applications.

I implemented core graph functionality, contact suggestion, influencer detection, and Kevin Bacon distance analysis. The project includes integration with a provided GUI for real-time visualization and interaction.

## üß© Key Components

### 1. `Graph310.java`
- Implements a custom **directed graph** using a map-of-maps (adjacency list).
- Manages vertex and edge operations, neighbors, in/out degrees, and incident data.
- Foundation for all algorithms and GUI operations.

### 2. `SuggestedContacts.java`
- Implements a **link prediction** algorithm based on common neighbors.
- Recommends potential connections ranked by similarity score.

### 3. `KevinBaconCalculator.java`
- Calculates the minimum number of directed jumps to reach the **Kevin Bacon** node.
- Uses BFS-like traversal to trace the shortest influence path.

### 4. `InfluencerDetection.java`
- Identifies **top influencers** in the network using the formula:
