# 🧬 Project 1 – Game of Life (Spring 2025)

This project simulates Conway's Game of Life, a classic example of cellular automata. It includes GUI-based grid simulation, a custom implementation of dynamic arrays, and RLE (Run-Length Encoded) pattern loading. Designed to deepen understanding of object-oriented programming, dynamic data structures, and GUI applications in Java.

## 🔧 Key Components

- `GameOfLife.java` – GUI controller and event handler
- `Simulation.java` – Handles grid logic, rules, evolution, and pattern loading
- `DynamicArray.java` – Custom resizable array class replacing ArrayList
- `Cell.java` – Represents each cell’s state and age

---

## 📌 Features

- Rule-based grid simulation (Conway’s rules)
- Grid toggling, reset, and evolution through generations
- Pattern loading using `.rle` files
- Age-based statistics (total alive cells, average age, max age)
- Dynamic GUI rendering and user interaction

## 📁 Project Files

- `GameOfLife.java`
