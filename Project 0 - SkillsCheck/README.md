# 📦 Project 0 – Skills Check (Spring 2025)

This project was created as part of CS310 to review and demonstrate foundational Java programming skills, including generics, exception handling, command line input, and documentation using JavaDocs.

## 🧪 Part 1: SingleItemBox

- Implemented a generic `SingleItemBox<T>` class.
- Used a constructor to accept any data type.
- Accessed the stored value using a `getItem()` method.
- Verified functionality using the provided `BoxUsageDemo.java`.
- Followed style and documentation standards with Checkstyle.

## 🍎 Part 2: AppleOrange

- Wrote a command-line program that prints numbers from 1 to X.
- Replaced:
  - Multiples of 3 with `"apple"`
  - Multiples of 7 with `"orange"`
  - Multiples of both with `"appleorange"`
- Validated input and handled errors with proper messages.
- Passed automated tests using JUnit (`AppleOrangeTest.java`).
